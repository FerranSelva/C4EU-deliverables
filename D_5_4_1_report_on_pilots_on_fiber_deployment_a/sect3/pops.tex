A Point-Of-Presence (POP) is an artificial demarcation point or interface point between communicating entities.
In our case we are referring to optical fiber interconnection points.
From 2010 until now the guifi.net community has raised six points of presence over the Catalan territory.
This POPs are following the network model of freedom and neutrality specified in the XOLN\ref{XOLN} licence.
Thus anyone is able to connect to them but always respecting the same conditions.

From a general perspective guifi.net community is building a set of neutral exchange points, leaving the
infrastructure available to the individuals, associations or either companies. These kind of POPs are named POP-IX making
reference to the internet exchange points (IX).
\medskip
Figure \ref{fig:fibre_map} shows the fiber network map of guifi.net POPs (not all of them).

\bigskip

The current guifi.net POPs are managed, maintained and also economically sustained for the community. 
To interconnect all of them it is need to use third party infrastructure. The FFTH projects are able to deploy some kilometres
of optical fiber but not hundreds or even thousands.
\newline
In Catalonia there exist a set of deployed fibers which are owned by the Catalan government, available to any entity and 
rented for a regularized price. Most of the guifi.net POPs are connected to such network to interchange data
between them. Figure \ref{fig:xoc_map} shows a slice of the network fiber map provided by the government.

\subsection{Pilot's POPs}

\subsubsection{Gurb}

Gurb is a small village in a rural area of the geographical center of Catalonia. Back in 2004 the first guifi.net community
was born here. Probably because of that Gurb is nowadays one of the places where the bottom-up broadband model has more
influence. As seen in section \ref{SECCIO} the community users deployed some optical fiber kilometres to reach the government
infrastructure and connect with other POPs.
\medskip
It is a very important point-of-presence because it allows a small data center provided and maintained by the community.
There are even ISP companies connected to such POP following and using the open-network model to provide Internet
connectivity to end users.

\subsection{Other POPs}

Other points-of-present not directly related with this project are the following.

\subsubsection{CATNIX}

\bigskip 

CATNIX\footnote{\url{http://www.catnix.net}} is the name of the internet exchange point (IX) of Catalonia. 
It is a physical infrastructure provided by the goberment to leave the network operators exchange their 
information and connect their networks (autonomous systems). 

\medskip
All guifi.net POPs terminate to such infrastructure (as can be shown in figure \ref{fig:fibre_map}) where
all of them connect together to became part of the main community network. 

\medskip
Guifi.net Foundation operates it's own backbone infrastructure using the ASN 49835 (Autonomous System Number). 
An open peering policy is followed to establish peering sessions with all potential partners.
The Foundation is part of the CATNIX, so it is also possible to exchange data with other ISP and
rent Internet up-link directly to an international carrier. Right now there is one symetric Internet gigabit 
available.
\medskip
This POP is a kind of central point, probably the most important of the guifi.net fiber network. 
To make it possible (as any other common ISP) a complete set of networking hardware such as routers, switches and so on is required (see figure \ref{fig:telvent_foto}). 
It is placed in a Barcelona CPD (data center), where the Foundation, with the support of many other entities, rents a space (rack).
\newline
All these infrastructure is completely managed and maintained by a group of volunteer community users named GLIR. 
It may surprise to someone but such model works, there are several companies or other kind of entities depending on it.
\newline
Figure \ref{fig:telvent_scheme} shows a connection scheme (layer 2) of the hardware used for the CATNIX POP. 
The first port of the switch SW-03 is the optical fiber which brings the data from the other POPs. As can be seen each
of them use a separate VLAN. The seventh port of the second switch is the connection with the carrier to reach the Internet.
And the eight is connected to the CATNIX infrastructure where the exchange of data with other ISPs and networks is possible.

\subsubsection{Tortosa}
Tortosa is a city placed on the south of Catalonia. The guifi.net users started a project named 
OpenFPnet\footnote{\url{http://openfpnet.guifi.net}} with the objective of create an open and neutral fiber backbone 
around the surrounding villages. This project was initially partially-funded by the government. 
\newline
Starting from that point they opened a POP to connect with the rest of guifi.net infrastructure. 
Currently it is economically sustained by community users grouped in associations and some company with interests in use
this open and neutral point.
