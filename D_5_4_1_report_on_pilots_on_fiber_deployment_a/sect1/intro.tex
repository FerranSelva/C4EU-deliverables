\IEEEPARstart{D}{espite} the scepticism of some people about the capacity of community networks (CNs) to incorporate the optical fibre (OF) technology in guifi.net there are many on-going initiatives\footnote{In the guifi.net jargon each of these initiatives is called \emph{a project}} to do so. The fact that some of these projects are already in the stage of being fully operational, bringing of Gbs/s broadband Internet access to places (such as rural areas) where the traditional telcos are currently offering connections of few Mbs/s at most, proves that it is totally feasible to deploy and operate OF infrastructure according to the CNs principals following a bottom-up approach, thus that the aforementioned scepticism is totally unfounded.

The present document reports the presence of OF in guifi.net, paying special attention to the three projects that have been selected as FO pilots~\cite{barcelo2012bub} in the Commons4Europe project and how they have progressed over the first year. The Gurb\footnote{Gurb, population 2.538, density 49,19 hab/km$^{2}$, located in the \emph{comarca} of Osona, Catalonia. It is a typical Catalan rural village formed by a few streets and many disseminated farms, some of them rather isolated.} project has been selected as a pilot because it was the first FO project started and the most advanced one.. The Vic\footnote{Vic, population 40.900, density 1.336,60 hab/km$^{2}$, the capital of the \emph{comarca} of Osona, Catalonia. It is a typical middle size Catalan city of the Catalan rural areas where most of the population lives in the urban area with several industrial parks.} pilot has been selected because it is a case of OF in an urban area. Finally Rub\'{i}\footnote{Vic, population 73.979, density 2.290,37 hab/km$^{2}$, located in the \emph{comarca} of Vall\`{e}s Occidental, Catalonia. It is a typical middle size Catalan city of the Barcelona surroundings where most of the population lives in the urban with several industrial parks.} has been selected as a case where the project at the moment is blocked.



TODO explain funny terms such Bottom-up Broadband, FFTF,

 All this has end up in a cross-fertilization 


 It is also where guifi.net project was started in 2003. Most of the houses have WiFi access to guifi.net network since long time ago
